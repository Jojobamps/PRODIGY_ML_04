### This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning model that performs hand gesture recognition using the leapGestRecog dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to create a system capable of classifying various hand gestures, which can be used to enable intuitive, gesture-based control systems for human-computer interaction.
